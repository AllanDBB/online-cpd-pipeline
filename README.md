# online-cpd-pipeline
End-to-end experimental pipeline for online change point detection (CPD) using synthetic time series. Includes parameter tuning, performance evaluation (MTTD, tolerance-based F1), and benchmarking with algorithms like CUSUM and EWMA. Designed as a modular framework to later integrate and test custom CPD algorithms for real-time anomaly detection.
