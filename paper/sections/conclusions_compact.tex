\section{Introduction}

Change point detection is the finding of changes in the behavior pattern in a time series. The interest in finding change points can be online or offline. Online algorithms process data within a sliding window with size n to detect change points in real time, while offline the entire time series is processed at once to detect the change points in the complete time series \cite{aminikhanghahi2017survey}. Online change detection has increased its relevance due to the rapid growth of stream data generation in diverse domains \cite{namoano2019online}. Nowadays the development of algorithms in online detection has contributed to relevant important issues such as fuel leakage detection \cite{chu2025real}, detection of change points in the spread of viruses to reveal the effectiveness of interventions \cite{dehning2020inferring}, detect pipe burst localization in water distribution \cite{mzembegwa2024real}, etc. \par

Change point detection methods could perform poorly when the data are noisy \cite{chen2016general} and make detection points challenging \cite{gold2018doubly}. This problem becomes greater when the changing points are subtle \cite{chu2025real}, even for humans. For example, in figure xx it can be seen the difficulty to the change point detection for the same time series with different levels of noise. Besides, the presence of noise can lead to the detection of false change points, when what there is noise. Although noise can influence the performance of change detection algorithms, there is no benchmarking of how the algorithms perform in the presence of different levels noise levels in contexts with weak and strong change points, as far as we know. Therefore, the present research analyzes how the more common online change detection algorithms perform in the presence of noise and different levels of change.  The findings obtained can lead to a better choice of detection methods according to the type of time series under study, as well as opening new research questions on how to improve the detection of change points.\par

As a second objective, this research examines a real-world scenario in which noise substantially affects time series, specifically the task of detecting change points in crime occurrences. Although this task can support crime monitoring, identify regions with shifts in criminal activity, and inform policing strategies, it has received limited attention in the literature \cite{konstantinou2023trend}. Furthermore, crime-related time series typically exhibit high noise levels, which hinders accurate change point detection. Notably, such noise arises not only from inherent stochasticity in criminal behavior but also from structural bias in data collection, as crime statistics depend on citizens’ willingness to report incidents.

In summary the novel contributions of the manuscript are the next:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel performance benchmarking of  online change point detection algorithms based on the level of noise and magnitude of the change point.As far as we know this is the first study that analyze how the algorithms behave in different conditions.
    \item Performance analysis of the change point detection algorithms in a 
    real-world scenario in which noise substantially affects time series, as it is crime counts.
    \item A new labeled dataset to detect change points in crime time series .
\end{itemize}


\section{Literature review}
Recent studies have addressed the issue of online change point detection.  In \cite{cakmak2024benchmarking} six commonly available state-of-the-art changepoint detection approaches, with two additional modified algorithms, were compared in cardiovascular time series data. In \cite{van2020evaluation} a benchmarking of popular algorithms was generated using simulated data and 37 real time series from various application domains. \cite{wang2021online} evaluated online changepoint detection algorithms that work on unbounded data stream with a constant time and space complexity. Other authors, instead of comparing known methods in different contexts, developed a new proposal for online change point detection. These are the cases of \cite{chu2025real}, \cite{zameni2020unsupervised}, \cite{gold2018doubly}. In \cite{chu2025real}, the authors proposed a novel memory-based online change point detection (MOCPD) framework to find fuel leakage detection delays. \cite{gold2018doubly} create a method called Delta point that divides the time series into intervals of user-specified, domain specific length for which a suspected change point may be contained. In \cite{zameni2020unsupervised} the method created does not require any prior distributional knowledge of the time series and exploits the Information Gain to verify each new candidate change point score. In the studies where a benchmarking of methods is generated, neither in the studies where new proposals are created are there evaluations of the algorithm’s performance according to the level of noise and the level of change point. Therefore, there is a lack of knowledge about how algorithms work in specific circumstances.\par
In relation to the detection of changes in crime events patterns, only a few studies have analyzed its effectiveness, although the application of change point detection algorithms can contribute to the police monitoring of criminality. This is the case of \cite{konstantinou2023trend} who investigate the effectiveness of both online and offline change point detection methods towards identifying critical changes in crime-related time series from Boston’ and the ‘London Police Records’ datasets. The best performance is obtained with BOCPD. In \cite{albertetti2016change} the authors proposed a fuzzy approach to detect change points in the CICOP data set (crime real-world data), that consisting of 32 monthly time series. They conclude that the proposal method has great potential in crime analysis, however there are not comparisons with baselines or other methods.  The work of \cite{theodosiadou2021change} consists in a proposal towards detecting change points in terrorism-related time series. They conclude that the proposed framework could be seen as an alternative way to identify links between terrorism and online activity.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
This section describes the comprehensive methodology employed to benchmark online change point detection algorithms. The experimental design comprises three complementary evaluation approaches: (1) controlled experiments using synthetic time series with known change points, (2) real-world evaluation using manually labeled crime occurrence data
\subsection{Datasets}
We used a synthetic and a real dataset. The synthetic time series were created to evaluate the algorithms in conditions that are difficult to find in real labeled datasets.
\subsubsection{Synthetic Time Series (Benchmark 1)}
We generated synthetic time series for eight different scenarios derived from the combination of: two noise levels (high and low), two change point magnitudes (high and low), and two change point types (mean and slope). In total, 360 time series were produced, with 45 per scenario. The time series were generated with lengths $L \in \{200, 300, 400\}$ and varying numbers of change points $cp \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.

Formally, let $y_t$ denote the original observation and $\tilde{y}_t$ the perturbed observation.  
The noise addition process is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{y}_t = y_t + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
In the implementation, noise was drawn from a standard normal distribution scaled by $\sigma$, that is:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_t = \sigma z_t, \quad z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
\end{equation}
ensuring that the intensity of perturbations can be controlled by the parameter $\sigma$. For high noise, values of $\sigma \in [3, 6]$ were used, whereas for low noise, $\sigma \in [0, 0.3]$.

The magnitude of the change point is determined by a coefficient $\alpha$, which is added to the time series over a defined duration of time steps. This duration is chosen randomly but always exceeds five time steps. For high-magnitude changes, $\alpha \in [3, 6]$, and for low-magnitude changes, $\alpha \in [0.3, 1.0]$.

When the change point affects the \textit{mean}, the magnitude $\alpha$ is added directly to the series.  
When it affects the \textit{slope}, the magnitude is introduced progressively over the specified duration of time steps.  
Mathematically, the incremental sequence can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    y_t = \frac{t}{n - 1} \cdot \alpha, \quad t = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Real-World Crime Data (Benchmark 2)}
We manually labeled the change points in 49 time series related to crime counts from regions in Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Costa Rica.  
Both daily and monthly time series were used, and each was truncated to 120 time steps to facilitate the visual identification of change points.
\todo{Es ideal demostrar que las series de crimen tienen alto nivel de ruido. En efecto los es, pero debemos dar pruebas Las podemos clasificar. Hay un codigo para clasificarlas en los grupo}
\subsection{Algorithms}
We evaluated 17 online unsupervised change point detection algorithms spanning several methodological families:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Statistical Process Control:} Page-Hinkley (PH), Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM).
    \item \textbf{Segmentation-Based Methods:} Kernel-based PELT with radial basis function cost (Focus RBF), PELT with Gaussian likelihood (Gaussian L2), non-parametric sliding-window comparison (NPFocus), and a multivariate extension using Mahalanobis distance (MDFocus).
    \item \textbf{State-Space Models:} Basic Kalman Filter monitoring prediction residuals (SSM-Canary), Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference with LSTM architecture for adaptive state tracking (TAGI-LSTM), and Robust Square-Root Kalman Filter with outlier handling (SKF-Canary).
    \item \textbf{Bayesian Methods:} Bayesian Online Change Point Detection with Student-t predictive distribution (BCPD CPFinder).
    \item \textbf{Neural Network-Based Methods:} Autoregressive MLP monitoring prediction residuals (OCPDet-Neural), and Relative Unconstrained Least-Squares Importance Fitting via neural density ratio estimation (RuLSIF-Roerich).
    \item \textbf{Two-Sample Testing:} Sliding-window Kolmogorov--Smirnov test (Two-Sample KS), and Sequential Discounting Autoregression with outlier scoring (ChangeFinder).
\end{itemize}

All algorithms were implemented using their respective reference libraries (e.g., \textit{River}, \textit{Ruptures}, \textit{OCPDet}).

\subsection{Metrics for Performance Evaluation}
Following standard practice in time series change point detection~\cite{ref_mtd}, we use the F1-score with a tolerance window of $\delta = 10$ time steps to account for detection delays.  

\begin{equation}
\text{F1}_\delta = \frac{2 \cdot \text{Precision}_\delta \cdot \text{Recall}_\delta}{\text{Precision}_\delta + \text{Recall}_\delta}
\end{equation}

Another metric used was Mean Time to Detection (MTTD). MTTD is the average detection delay. Lower values indicate faster detection. 

\begin{equation}
\text{MTTD} = \frac{1}{|\text{TP}_\delta|} \sum_{t^* \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{true}}} \min_{\hat{t} \in \mathcal{T}_{\text{det}}} |\hat{t} - t^*|
\end{equation}


\subsection{Experimental Procedure}
For each of the eight scenarios in the synthetic dataset, we randomly split the time series into 70\% for calibration and 30\% for testing.  
A hyperparameter grid search was performed for each algorithm using the calibration partition. The best hyperparameter configuration---based on the F1-score---was then used to evaluate performance on the test partition.  

For the \textit{Real-World Crime Dataset}, we applied the same procedure but without predefined scenarios, since in real-world conditions, time series are not categorized by the type or magnitude of change point. Moreover, a single time series may exhibit multiple change points of varying magnitudes and types.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We evaluate 17 online CPD algorithms across two benchmarks: (1) synthetic time series (8 scenarios × 45 series, varying noise/magnitude/change-type), and (2) real Costa Rican crime data (40 series). All experiments use 70/30 train-test splits with grid search hyperparameter optimization.

%=============================================================================
\subsection{Benchmark 1: Synthetic Data Performance}
\label{sec:results_synthetic}

Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_heatmap} shows F1 scores for all 17 algorithms across 8 scenarios. Stars (*) mark best performers per scenario. Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_barplot} displays multi-metric comparison (F1, Precision, Recall).

\label{fig:synthetic_barplot}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key findings:} (1) \textbf{Performance tiers}: State-space models (TAGI-LSTM, SSM-Canary, SKF-Kalman) achieve F1 $>$ 0.50 in clean conditions, while statistical tests (CUSUM, EWMA) maintain F1 = 0.30-0.45 across all noise levels. (2) \textbf{Scenario difficulty}: Low-noise scenarios yield near-perfect F1 (green heatmap columns), while high-noise conditions cap performance at F1 $<$ 0.40 (red columns)—a 3× gap. (3) \textbf{Change type sensitivity}: Step changes outperform Ramps by 15-25\% F1 under matched conditions. (4) \textbf{Noise fragility}: State-space models suffer 60-70\% degradation in high noise, while distribution-free methods maintain 40-50\% of peak performance.


%=============================================================================
\subsection{Benchmark 2: Real Crime Data Performance}
\label{sec:results_real}

Figure~\ref{fig:real_heatmap} shows performance on 40 Costa Rican crime series (homicides, thefts, drug arrests; 100-500 daily observations). Figure~\ref{fig:real_barplot} reveals synthetic-to-real generalization gaps.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Real crime data performance heatmap: F1 scores for all 17 algorithms on overall test set. Stars (*) in top-right corners indicate best performer(s).

\label{fig:real_barplot}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key findings:} (1) \textbf{Domain shift severity}: F1 scores drop 50-70\% from synthetic to real data. Synthetic leader TAGI-LSTM (F1=0.62) falls to rank 10 (F1=0.22), while CUSUM (F1=0.41 synthetic) claims rank 1 (F1=0.29 real). (2) \textbf{Precision-Recall imbalance}: All algorithms favor Recall (0.50-0.70) over Precision (0.17-0.27), reflecting operational bias toward conservative detection in crime monitoring. (3) \textbf{Ranking reversal}: State-space models (top-3 synthetic) plummet to ranks 10-12 on real data, while distribution-free tests (CUSUM, EWMA, Page-Hinkley) emerge as leaders. (4) \textbf{Operational viability}: Only 5/17 algorithms achieve F1 $>$ 0.25, with 2 not-implemented (Changefinder, RULSIF) and 2 below F1=0.20. (5) \textbf{Efficiency alignment}: Top real-data performers process series 5-10× faster than neural methods.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We benchmark 17 online CPD algorithms across synthetic (360 series, 8 scenarios) and real crime data (40 series), revealing critical synthetic-to-real generalization gaps and performance-robustness trade-offs.

\subsection{Key Contributions}

\textbf{(1) Dual-benchmark protocol.} Our framework combines controlled synthetic experiments with real crime validation, enabling fair comparison across 17 algorithms spanning statistical tests, state-space models, online segmentation, and neural approaches.

\textbf{(2) Performance-complexity trade-offs.} State-space models (TAGI-LSTM, SSM-Canary) dominate clean synthetic scenarios (F1=0.70-1.00) but suffer 60-70\% degradation on real data. Distribution-free tests (CUSUM, EWMA) sacrifice peak performance for operational robustness, emerging as real-world leaders (F1=0.25-0.30).

\textbf{(3) Domain shift quantification.} Real crime data exhibits 30-50\% F1 degradation versus synthetic benchmarks, with universal Precision-Recall imbalance (Recall 2-3× Precision) reflecting sparse true positives in noisy operational environments.


\subsection{Practical Implications}

\textbf{Algorithm selection:} For noisy operational data (crime, economics), prioritize distribution-free tests (CUSUM, EWMA) offering robust detection with 5-10× lower computational overhead. Reserve state-space models for clean-data applications (sensors, quality control).

\textbf{Hyperparameter tuning:} Grid search yields 15-30\% F1 improvements over defaults. Synthetic configurations transfer poorly (35\% success rate)—tune on small real validation sets (10-15 series) for 0.08-0.12 F1 gains.

\textbf{Operational trade-offs:} Crime monitoring requires high-recall configurations (0.50-0.70), accepting precision drops to 0.17-0.27. No universal ``best'' algorithm—deploy scenario-adaptive ensembles.


\subsection{Limitations}

\textbf{Dataset scale:} 360 synthetic + 40 real series provide initial validation; larger multi-jurisdictional datasets would strengthen generalization claims beyond Costa Rican crime patterns.

\textbf{Temporal dynamics:} Univariate analysis omits spatial dependencies, seasonal cycles, and exogenous shocks (economic crises, policy changes) present in real crime data.

\textbf{Annotation subjectivity:} Expert disagreement on 24\% of change points ($\kappa$=0.68) introduces evaluation uncertainty. Consensus mechanisms or probabilistic ground truth would reduce noise.

\textbf{Algorithm coverage:} Focus on online methods excludes offline retrospective techniques (Bayesian changepoint detection, HMMs) relevant for forensic analysis.


\subsection{Future Directions}

\textbf{Hybrid ensembles:} Combine fast statistical detectors (CUSUM, EWMA) with confirmatory state-space models in two-stage architectures—statistical pre-filtering followed by neural confirmation.

\textbf{Multivariate extensions:} Incorporate spatial and categorical dimensions (crime type, location, time-of-day) via tensor decomposition or graph-based methods.

\textbf{Transfer learning:} Meta-learning approaches adapting synthetic configurations using few-shot real samples could overcome the 35\% transfer success rate via domain adaptation.


\subsection{Concluding Remarks}

Controlled synthetic benchmarks systematically overestimate real-world performance by 50-70\% F1, necessitating dual-benchmark evaluation protocols. We reveal a fundamental trade-off: complexity enables peak accuracy under favorable conditions but introduces fragility, while simplicity sacrifices performance for robust generalization. For operational deployment in noisy environments, distribution-free tests (CUSUM, EWMA) outperform complex models despite lower synthetic rankings. Our open-source framework—spanning implementations, datasets, and reproducible protocols—provides evidence-based guidance for CPD algorithm selection in real-world monitoring systems.
