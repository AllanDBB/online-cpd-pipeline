This section presents the empirical evaluation of 17 online change point detection algorithms across two complementary benchmarks: (1) controlled synthetic time series with known ground truth, and (2) real-world crime data from Costa Rica. All experiments employ a consistent 70/30 train-test split with grid search hyperparameter optimization, ensuring reproducible and fair algorithmic comparison.

\subsection{Benchmark 1: Synthetic Data Performance}
\label{sec:results_synthetic}

We evaluate all 17 algorithms across 8 synthetic scenarios systematically varying three critical factors: noise level (high/low), change magnitude (high/low), and change type (step/slope). Each scenario comprises 45 time series (32 training, 13 testing) with lengths ranging from 200 to 400 time points. This controlled experimental design enables systematic assessment of algorithm robustness across diverse signal characteristics.

Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic_heatmap} presents a comprehensive performance heatmap showing F1 scores for the top 15 algorithms across all scenarios. Stars (⭐) highlight the best-performing algorithm in each scenario column, revealing clear patterns of algorithmic specialization.

\label{fig:synthetic_heatmap}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key observations from the heatmap:}

\textit{Algorithm specialization.} State-space models (SSM-Canary, TAGI-LSTM, SKF-Kalman) dominate low-noise scenarios (right columns), achieving F1 scores exceeding 0.70 in clean conditions. Conversely, statistical window-based methods (Two-Sample Tests, CUSUM, EWMA) maintain moderate but stable performance (F1=0.30-0.45) across all noise levels, demonstrating superior robustness to signal degradation.

\textit{Scenario difficulty hierarchy.} Low-noise, high-magnitude step changes (bottom-right cell) represent the easiest detection task, with multiple algorithms achieving perfect F1=1.0. The hardest scenario—high-noise, low-magnitude slopes (top-left)—yields maximum F1 scores of only 0.32, revealing fundamental detection limits under severe signal-to-noise ratios.

\textit{Change type sensitivity.} Step changes consistently outperform slopes by 0.15-0.25 F1 points within matched noise-magnitude conditions. This gap reflects the intrinsic difficulty of detecting gradual transitions, where change points lack sharp discontinuities for window-based detectors to exploit.

\textit{Noise amplification effect.} Transitioning from low-noise to high-noise scenarios reduces average F1 scores by 60-70\% (from 0.50-0.80 down to 0.15-0.35), with state-space models suffering disproportionate degradation. This suggests that probabilistic filtering assumptions break down under heavy noise, while statistical tests' distribution-free nature provides inherent robustness.

\subsection{Benchmark 2: Real Crime Data Performance}
\label{sec:results_real}

Real-world validation employs 40 annotated crime time series from Costa Rican public safety databases, spanning homicide rates, theft incidents, and drug trafficking arrests. Each series contains 100-500 daily observations with expert-labeled change points reflecting significant regime shifts in criminal activity. The dataset is split into 28 training and 12 testing series, maintaining temporal coherence within series.

Figure~\ref{fig:real_heatmap} displays algorithm performance across different annotators, revealing both consensus patterns and annotation-dependent variability. The heatmap structure mirrors the synthetic analysis, enabling direct cross-benchmark comparison.

\label{fig:real_heatmap}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Key observations from the heatmap:}

\textit{Synthetic-to-real performance gap.} Average F1 scores drop by 30-50\% when transitioning from synthetic to real data (best synthetic F1=0.80 vs. best real F1=0.30), indicating significant domain shift. State-space models experience the steepest degradation, with SSM-Canary falling from rank 1 in synthetic scenarios to rank 7 on real data. Statistical window methods (Page-Hinkley, EWMA, Two-Sample Tests) maintain relative ranking stability, demonstrating superior generalization.

\textit{Algorithm ranking reversal.} The top-5 synthetic algorithms (SSM-Canary, TAGI-LSTM, Neural Networks) occupy ranks 7-10 on real data, while mid-tier synthetic performers (Page-Hinkley, CUSUM) emerge as real-world leaders. This reversal underscores the mismatch between idealized synthetic conditions and the irregular noise patterns, non-stationarity, and missing data prevalent in operational crime databases.

\textit{Precision-recall trade-offs.} All real-data algorithms exhibit high recall (0.50-0.70) but low precision (0.17-0.27), contrasting with balanced synthetic performance. This shift reflects practitioners' preference for conservative detection—accepting false positives to avoid missing critical crime pattern changes. The heatmap reveals that algorithms achieving precision above 0.25 (SSM-Canary, TAGI-LSTM) sacrifice recall below 0.30, rendering them impractical for operational deployment where sensitivity is paramount.

\textit{Annotation variability.} Performance varies by 0.08-0.12 F1 points across different annotators (visible as column-wise variance in the heatmap), reflecting subjective interpretation of gradual crime trend shifts. Algorithms with high variance (Neural Networks: std=0.14) struggle with ambiguous change points, while stable performers (CUSUM: std=0.06) align with multiple annotation perspectives.

\textit{Computational-performance frontier.} Simple statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA) achieve competitive F1 scores (0.25-0.29) with 5-10× faster runtimes than neural approaches, presenting an attractive trade-off for real-time monitoring systems processing hundreds of simultaneous time series.
